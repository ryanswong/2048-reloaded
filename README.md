# 2048-reloaded
A revamped python 2048 game

## Getting Started
1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

    We will be using git to version control the project as well as allow for group contribution.

2. Install pipenv. It's a more robust version of python pip.

    We will use pipenv to easily install the packages and dependencies we need in this project
    
    To install, type in your terminal/cmd:
    ```
    pip install pipenv
    ```
    make sure that Pipfile and Pipfile.lock is inside the directory
    (if not, make sure that you have properly cloned this repository)
    
    then go to your 2048-reloaded directory and run 
    ```
    pipenv sync
    ```

just text in chat if you need help on anything!
remember, this project is just for fun. no one has any obligations and responsibilities
