# 2048-reloaded
A revamped python 2048 game

## Getting Started
### 1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
We will be using git to version control the project as well as allow for group contribution.

**Helpful articles on how to use git:**

* [Getting Started on Git and Github (Lots of great links)](https://github.com/maptime/getting-started-with-git-and-github/blob/master/README.md)
* [Github Guide (10 minute read)](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
* [Learn Git with Bitbucket Cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud)
* [Official git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-Git-Basics)
* [Git commands cheat-sheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/)

**Cloning this project**

* Open your cmd/terminal/ (wherever you want to run your git commands), go to your directory (I would recommend making a "projects" folder) where you want the 2048-reloaded project folder to rest in. 

* Then type in:

        git clone https://github.com/suzuryu9000/2048-reloaded.git

* When you use dir/ls, you should see the "2048-reloaded" folder there


### 2. Install pipenv. It's a more robust version of python pip.

We will use pipenv to easily install the packages and dependencies we need in this project

* To install, type in your terminal/cmd:

        pip install pipenv

* Make sure that Pipfile and Pipfile.lock is inside the directory
(if not, make sure that you have properly cloned this repository)

* Then go to your 2048-reloaded directory and run. (This will install all packages we need such as pygame, or any other ones we decide to use in the future)

        pipenv sync

* To see all pipenv commands type in:

        pipenv -h
